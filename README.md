## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox

### What I learned

I started this project awhile ago and then came back to it. I have made small changes, but still don't have everything right. I still have a lot to learn about positioning content. 

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on advanced CSS that will help in future projects.
